description: Create component-level summaries (responsibilities, interfaces, data, and extension points)
---

**Mandatory preparation:** read [codebase overview](../instructions/includes/codebase-overview-baseline.include.md) instructions in full and follow strictly its rules before executing any step below.

## Goal

Create (or update): [component catalogue](../../docs/codebase-overview/component-*.md)

Also ensure they are linked from:[codebase overview](../../docs/codebase-overview/README.md) output

---

## Discovery (run before writing)

### A. Refresh what is already known

1. Re-read: [repository map](../../docs/codebase-overview/repository-map.md).
2. Extract (briefly) into working notes:
   - Deployable units and entry points
   - Repo-level architecture statement and tech stack summary (do not repeat in every component)
   - Domains / bounded areas already mentioned
   - Datastores and external services already identified
   - Key configuration locations (values files, env var lists, config structs)

### B. Find explicit component boundaries (structure-driven)

1. Identify package/module boundaries from repository structure and manifests, for example:
   - Monorepo boundaries: `apps/`, `services/`, `packages/`, `libs/`, `api/`
   - Language-specific roots: `src/`, `cmd/`, `internal/`, `pkg/`, `cli/`
   - Package manifests and workspace configuration (per ecosystem)
2. Identify "shared" vs "owned" code:
   - Shared libraries/packages
   - Common utilities
   - Cross-cutting frameworks (logging, auth, config)

### C. Find implicit component boundaries (runtime-driven)

1. Locate registries and composition roots, for example:
   - HTTP route registration / controllers
   - DI containers / service registries
   - Plugin/module loaders
   - Background job schedulers / worker registries
2. Use these to confirm which components are real at runtime (not just folders).

## Steps

### 1) Select components (explicit criteria)

1. Select **12** components that best represent the architecture.
2. Prefer components that are:
   - Deployable units (services/apps/workers/CLIs), or
   - Major domain modules, or
   - Shared platform libraries used across multiple units
3. Ensure coverage across:
   - Primary user/system flows
   - Data ownership (who writes/reads what)
   - Integration surfaces (APIs/events/queues)
4. If selection is ambiguous, record the criteria in the component catalogue (e.g. "picked by deployability + domain ownership + highest call volume surfaces", evidence-based where possible).

### 2) Create one document per component (consistent scope)

For each component, create:

- `docs/codebase-overview/component-[XXX]-[name].md`

Where:

- `[XXX]` is a stable numeric order (e.g. `001`, `002`, `003`, ...) so links don't churn
- `[name]` is short and meaningful (kebab-case)

For each component document, capture:

#### 2A. Identity and scope

- Component name
- Component type (service/app/worker/CLI/library/module)
- Where it lives in the repo (folder roots)
- What it owns vs what it depends on (one short "Boundaries" paragraph)
- Architecture role (one line): e.g. edge/API, orchestration, domain core, integration adapter, persistence, shared platform

#### 2B. Purpose and responsibilities

- Purpose (why it exists)
- Responsibilities (bullet list; start each bullet with a verb)
- Non-responsibilities (what it explicitly does not do), if inferable

#### 2C. Internal structure and key abstractions

- Key modules/packages
- Key symbols (classes/functions) that represent the "public surface" of the component
- Composition root / startup wiring location (where applicable)
- Design patterns utilised (e.g. repository, mediator, ports/adapters) **only if evidenced**

#### 2D. Interfaces (split and explicit)

- **Inbound interfaces** (how other things call it)
  - HTTP routes (include route patterns and where they're registered)
  - Events/topics/queues consumed
  - CLI commands (if applicable)
  - Scheduled triggers (cron/schedules) (if applicable)
- **Outbound interfaces** (what it calls)
  - Downstream HTTP/gRPC clients
  - Events/topics/queues published
  - External dependencies (identity, email, payments, etc.)

#### 2E. Data flows and lineage (only if evidenced)

Include a brief, evidence-based view of how data moves through (or is produced/consumed by) this component.

- **Owned data (source of truth):** {entities/tables/collections/schemas this component owns and writes}
- **Derived/replicated data:** {materialised views, projections, caches, read models}
- **Consumed data (read-only):** {entities/events this component reads but does not own}
- **Published data:** {events/messages produced, schema locations, topics/queues}
- **Consumed data streams:** {events/messages consumed, schema locations, topics/queues}
- **Transformations:** {where data is validated/transformed/enriched; key modules/symbols}
- **Lineage notes:** {origin → transformations → destinations} (keep to 1–3 bullets)

If any item cannot be supported by code/config, record:

- **Unknown from code – {suggested action}**

Add evidence bullets for each of the above categories, for example:

- Evidence: [/path/to/migrations](/path/to/migrations) - {table/entity}
- Evidence: [/path/to/producer](/path/to/producer#L10-L40) - {event name/topic}
- Evidence: [/path/to/consumer](/path/to/consumer#L50-L120) - {handler/topic}
- Evidence: [/path/to/schema](/path/to/schema) - {schema name/version}

#### 2F. Cross-cutting concerns (component-specific, no duplication)

Document component-specific implementation details only. If a concern is identical across many components, capture it once (in the most "central" component or a shared doc) and link to it rather than repeating.

- Authentication/authorisation integration points (middleware/guards/clients)
- Error handling strategy (exceptions, error mapping, retry wrappers)
- Logging and correlation (how IDs are propagated)
- Validation (where it happens and what enforces it)
- Configuration and secrets (entry points, key env/config names)

#### 2G. Configuration and feature control

- Config files and config entry points
- Environment variables / config keys used by the component
- Feature flags (where declared, how evaluated)

#### 2H. Observability and operability

- Logging: where it is configured and how correlation is handled (if present)
- Metrics: what is emitted and where
- Tracing: instrumentation and propagation (if present)
- Health checks / readiness / liveness endpoints (if present)
- Retry/backoff/idempotency patterns (if present)

#### 2I. Evolution and extension patterns (only if evidenced)

- Variation points (interfaces, plugins, strategy objects, hook systems)
- How to add a new handler/route/integration safely (where to register)
- Configuration-driven behaviour (what can be changed without code)
- Backwards-compatibility constraints (API versions, event schema evolution), if present

#### 2J. Evidence (mandatory)

- Evidence bullets with:
  - File paths (URLs must be prefixed with `/` so links resolve correctly)
  - Symbols and/or config keys
- If a field cannot be supported by code/config, record:
  - **Unknown from code – {action to confirm}**

### 3) Keep unknowns visible (no guessing)

1. If the component is referenced in docs but not found in code, record:
   - **Unknown from code – verify existence / locate entry point**
2. If a dependency is implied but not evidenced, record:
   - **Unknown from code – locate client initialisation / env var / IaC resource**

### 4) Write concisely, then iterate

1. Write a first draft for all components.
2. Then do a second pass:
   - Improve evidence links
   - Replace vague terms with precise names (symbols/routes/topics/config keys)
   - Reduce duplication across components (move shared info into a shared section or link)

### 5) Update the index

Update: [codebase overview](../../docs/codebase-overview/README.md) with a **Component Catalogue** section linking to every component document (in `[XXX]` order).
