You must adhere to the following mandatory task creation requirements when generating development tasks.

## Test-Driven Development (Mandatory)

- [ ] Define tasks using a strict TDD approach
- [ ] For each specified functionality, sequence tasks as Red (write failing test first), Green (implement to pass), then Refactor (improve code without changing behaviour)
- [ ] Ensure tests are always listed before implementation tasks
